		<p>In aggregating &amp; digitizing information our teams have made every effort to ensure that the material provided herein is current, however we can&#8217;t guarantee (yet) that our data has been updated with the very latest information from the individual cities&#8217; websites.</p>
		<p>We would <strong>love to be able to make such warranties about the currency of our data,</strong> if only this information was made available as Open Data. That way we don&#8217;t have a &#8220;scrub&#8221; the data and instead just &#8220;connect&#8221; to the city&#8217;s datasets and give you the latest and greatest from one definitive source.</p>
		<p>So, ask your councilor or representative to support the Open Data movement, so that we can programmatically (and easily) use the data that we already paid for with our taxpayer&#8217;s dollars.</p>
